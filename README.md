E-commerce JavaScript Application

A simple e-commerce web application built with pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project demonstrates REST API integration and dynamic product filtering using a free public API.
Features
Complete product management system with full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Users can add new products, edit existing ones, and delete products through REST API integration. The application includes advanced filtering options by category and price range, with seamless multi-page navigation and responsive design that works on all devices.

Technologies Used
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+, and a free public REST API for backend data management.
What I Learned
This project significantly improved my skills in working with REST APIs, managing application state, implementing filtering functionality, and creating better user experiences. The main difference between this and my previous projects is the depth of API integration and data management complexity.
API Used
This project uses a free public API for product data management, allowing full CRUD operations without requiring backend setup.
Future Improvements
Planning to add shopping cart functionality, user authentication, product search feature, pagination, sorting options, loading states, error handling, and a product details page.
